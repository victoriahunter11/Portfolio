Updated Portfolio

Link:  https://victoriahunter11.github.io/Portfolio/

To create this updated portfolio, I used CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap. I found a theme from https://startbootstrap.com/ to use as my foundation for this portfolio.  Here you can find a few of my bigger projects I have done for the Full-Stack Development course thus far, as well as a little about me.
