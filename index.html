                My name is Victoria Hunter. I was originally born in Shelby, NC, which is in the foothills.
              I am currently in Raleigh, NC. I have a BS in Business Management with a concentration
              in Information Systems.  Through this, I learned about the business
              side of information systems, and also took two coding classes: C# and SQL.</p>

              <p>
               In my major, I realized I enjoyed the
              design aspect of creating a product rather than the use cases and planning before. This led me to a Software Development internship from Allscripts
              following graduation. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and continued on to a job at Allscripts as an Associate Software Engineer. While I learned a lot doing this hands-on,
              I felt like there was more schooling I needed to do which led me to this bootcamp. While starting at Allscripts mainly front-end, this bootcamp
              will help me get the back-end experience I need as well.
